# taganomaly
Anomaly detection labeling tool, specifically for multiple time series (one time series per category).

Taganamoly is a tool for creating labeled data for anomaly detection models. It allows the labeler to select points on a time series, further inspect them by looking at the behavior of other times series at the same time range, or by looking at the raw data that created this time series (assuming that the time series is an aggregated metric, counting events per time range)

#### Compare this category with others over time

#### Look at the changes in distribution between categories
This could be useful to understand whether an anomaly was univariate or multivariate

## Requirements
- R (3.4.0 or above)
### Used packages: 
- shiny
- dplyr
- gridExtra
- shinydashboard
- DT
- ggplot2


packages will be installed upon start if missing (see [global.R]). This might take a few minutes upon the first run.

## How to run locally:
This tool uses the [shiny framework](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for visualizing events.
In order to run it, you need to have [R](https://mran.microsoft.com/download) and preferably [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
Once you have everything installed, open the project on R studio and click "Run App", or call runApp() from the console. You might need to manually install the required packages

## How to deploy using docker:
Option 1: [Deploy to Azure Web App for Containers](https://azuredeploy.net/). More details [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/containers/)

Option 2: Deploy [this image](https://hub.docker.com/r/omri374/taganomaly/) to your own environment.

### Dockerize the shiny app yourself:
Follow the steps on [rize](https://github.com/cole-brokamp/rize) on how to deploy on shiny-server. Default port is 3838, so make sure you have it open or change the default port to somethine else.


## Instructions of use
1. Import time series CSV file. Assumed structure:
- date ("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
- category
- value

2. (Optional) Import raw data time series CSV file.

If the original time series is an aggreation over time windows, this time series is the raw values themselves. This way we could dive deeper into an anomalous value and see what it is comprised of.
Assumed structure:
- date ("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
- category
- value

2. Select category (if exists)

3. Select time range on slider

4.Select points on plot that look anomalous.
Optional (1): click on one time range on the table below the plot to see raw data on this time range
Optional (2): Open the "All Categories" tab to see how other time series behave on the same time range.
5. Once you decide that these are actual anomalies, save the resulting table to csv by clicking on "Download labels set" and continue to the next category.

#### Current limitations/issues
It is currently impossible to have multiple selections on one plot. A workaround is to select one area, download the csv and select the next area. Each downloaded CSV has a random string so files aren't supposed to override each other.
